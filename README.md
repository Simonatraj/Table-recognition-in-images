This repository provides a model for detecting tables in images and converting their content into structured Excel files. 
I used the Ultralytics library and YOLO models to automate the process of table detection and content extraction from a variety of image types. 
To build the foundation of the system, I leveraged pre-trained YOLO models and a dataset from Roboflow. 

To enhance the model's accuracy, I systematically adjusted hyperparameters, including batch size, image size, and the number of training epochs. 
I evaluated the system's performance using metrics such as F1 score, mean average precision (mAP), precision, recall, and intersection over union (IoU). 
By analyzing these metrics, I fine-tuned the system to ensure it achieved high accuracy and reliability across diverse scenarios.
